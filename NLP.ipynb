    "Natural language processing is a field concerned with the ability of a computer to understand, analyze, manipulate, and potentially generate human language. By human language, we're simply referring to any language used for everyday communication. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So here are a few examples that you may see on a day to day basis:\n",
    "\n",
    ">The first would be a spam filter, so this is just where your email server is determining whether an incoming email is spam or not, based on the content of the body, the subject, and maybe the email domain. \n",
    "\n",
    ">The second is auto-complete, where Google is basically predicting what you're interested in searching for based on what you've already entered and what others commonly search for with those same phrases. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP is a very broad umbrella that encompasses many topics like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "* Topic Modeling\n",
    "* Text Classification\n",
    "* Sentence Segmentation or Part-or-Speech Tagging\n",
    "\n",
    "The core component of natural language processing is extracting all the information from a block of text that is relevant to a computer understanding the language.\n",

    "I used the following command to install NLTK:\n",
    "\n",
